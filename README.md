# GCP Secure Delivery Platform

Google-native secure delivery platform for GKE using Cloud Build, Cloud Deploy, Binary Authorization, Terraform, and Cloud Operations.

## Overview

This repository is a platform-style project that demonstrates how to build, verify, promote, deploy, and observe containerized workloads on Google Cloud.

It is intentionally designed around a **trusted release path** rather than a single pipeline. The core idea is simple:

**Code → Build → Verify → Store → Approve → Promote → Deploy → Observe**

The project focuses on secure software delivery to GKE with Google-native services and production-oriented operational thinking.

## Why this project matters

Many teams have CI/CD, but they do not have a clearly governed release path.

Typical gaps include:
- build and deployment are connected, but trust is weak
- artifacts are pushed without clear release controls
- deployment policies are inconsistent
- release promotion across environments is not formalized
- post-deployment validation is not tied to release decisions

This project addresses that by turning delivery into a governed system with:
- secure build orchestration
- trusted artifact handling
- controlled promotion between environments
- deployment admission controls
- cloud-native observability after release

## Core capabilities

### 1. Secure build and verification
- Cloud Build as the CI execution layer
- quality and security gates before release
- container image build workflow
- release-oriented verification flow

### 2. Trusted artifacts
- Artifact Registry as the artifact store
- Binary Authorization as the trust and deployment gate
- clear separation between built artifacts and deployable artifacts

### 3. Controlled release promotion
- Cloud Deploy pipeline for environment progression
- explicit dev → stage → prod path
- promotion as a governed action, not just a script step

### 4. GKE deployment governance
- Kubernetes manifests deployed through a controlled release path
- environment-aware rollout structure
- deployment controls centered around release trust

### 5. Cloud-native operability
- Cloud Monitoring dashboards
- Cloud Logging visibility
- operator-friendly release review workflow

## Roadmap

The project roadmap is organized around the trusted release model before deeper infrastructure implementation:

1. **Trusted Release Model** — release identity, trust model, promotion semantics, and environment policies.
2. **Minimal Executable Foundation** — Terraform foundation, Artifact Registry, one GKE cluster, IAM baseline, and Cloud Build trigger path.
3. **Executable Trusted Path** — verification logic, attestation concept, Binary Authorization, and blocked deployment scenario.
4. **Controlled Promotion** — Cloud Deploy and explicit dev → stage → prod progression.
5. **Operational Visibility** — observability tied to release identity and operator review.
6. **Demo Packaging** — runnable scenarios and portfolio-ready presentation.

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the detailed roadmap.
